🌾 Ethiopian Local Price Tracker

The Ethiopian Local Price Tracker is a web platform designed to solve a common challenge: the lack of transparent, up-to-date, and reliable information on local market prices for farmers, traders, and consumers.

Farmers often sell their goods without knowing the fair price, while consumers may overpay due to misinformation. This project empowers users by allowing them to view, share, and compare real-time market prices of crops, livestock, and other goods across Ethiopia.
